This is a React/Redux portfolio project.
The App`s goal is to visualize the effects of the different Flexbox settings.

On the left side are the settings panels: one for adjusting the number of so called ActionBoxes.
Secound contains dropdowns to modify those Flexbox settings that are applicable only for PARENT components.
The third one is similar to the 2nd one, but the settings are applicable only for CHILD components.

On the right side are the so called ACTIONBOXes. These are colored boxes, and the user can alter the appearances
of these boxes selecting the different Flexbox dropdown options.
